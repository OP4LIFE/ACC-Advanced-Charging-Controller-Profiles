# WARNINGS

# Do not edit this in Windows Notepad, ever!
# It replaces LF (Linux/Unix) with CRLF (Windows) line endings.

# As you may have guessed, what is null by default, can be null.
# "language=" is interpreted as "language=en".
# Nullifying values that should not be null causes unexpected behavior.
# However, doing so with "--set var=" restores the default value of "var".
# In other words, for regular users, "--set" is safer than modifying the config file directly.

# Do not feel like you must configure everything!
# Do not change what you don't understand.


# NOTES

# The daemon does not have to be restarted after making changes to this file - unless one of the changes is capacity_freeze2 or charging_switch.

# If charging_switch is changed with --set (e.g., -ss, -s s="...", --set charging_switch="..."), accd is restarted automatically, as needed.

# FINE, BUT WHAT DOES EACH OF THESE VARIABLES ACTUALLY MEAN?

# configVerCode #
# This is checked during updates to determine whether config should be patched. Do NOT modify.

# shutdown_capacity (sc) #
# When the battery is discharging and its capacity/voltage_now_millivolts <= sc and phone has been running for 15 minutes or more, acc daemon turns the phone off to reduce the discharge rate and protect the battery from potential damage induced by voltage below the operating range.
# sc=0 disables it.
# The daemon posts Android shutdown warning notifications at sc+10%, sc+5%, sc+300mV and sc+100mV.

# cooldown_capacity (cc) #
# Capacity/voltage_now_millivolts at which the cooldown cycle starts.
# Cooldown reduces battery stress induced by prolonged exposure to high temperature and high charging voltage.
# It does so through periodically pausing charging for a few seconds (more details below).

# resume_capacity (rc) #
# Capacity or voltage_now_millivolts at which charging should resume.

# pause_capacity (pc) #
# Capacity or voltage_now_millivolts at which charging should pause.

# capacity_freeze2 (cft) #
# This prevents Android from getting capacity readings below 2%.
# It's useful on systems that shutdown before the battery is actually empty.

# cooldown_temp (ct) #
# Temperature (°C) at which the cooldown cycle starts.
# Cooldown reduces the battery degradation rate by lowering the device's temperature.
# Refer back to cooldown_capacity for more details.

# max_temp (mt) #
# mtp or max_temp_pause #
# These two work together and are NOT tied to the cooldown cycle.
# On max_temp (°C), charging is paused for max_temp_pause (seconds).
# Unlike the cooldown cycle, which aims at reducing BOTH high temperature and high voltage induced stress - this is ONLY meant specifically for reducing high temperature induced stress.
# Even though both are separate features, this complements the cooldown cycle when environmental temperatures are off the charts.

# shutdown_temp (st) #
# Shutdown the system if battery temperature >= this value.

# cooldown_charge (cch) #
# cooldown_pause (cp) #
# These two dictate the cooldown cycle intervals (seconds).
# When not set, the cycle is disabled.
# Suggested values are cch=50 and cp=10.
# If charging gets a bit slower than desired, try cch=50 and cp=5.
# Note that cooldown_capacity and cooldown_temp can be disabled individually by assigning them values that would never be reached under normal circumstances.

# cooldown_custom (ccu) #
# When cooldown_capacity and/or cooldown_temp don't suit your needs, this comes to the rescue.
# It takes precedence over the regular cooldown settings.
# Refer back the command examples.

# cooldown_current (cdc) #
# Instead of pausing charging periodically during the cooldown phase, limit the max charging current (e.g., to 500 mA)

# reset_batt_stats_on_pause (rbsp) #
# Reset battery stats after pausing charging.

# reset_batt_stats_on_unplug (rbsu) #
# Reset battery stats if the charger has been unplugged for 10 seconds.

# charging_switch (s) #
# If unset, acc cycles through its database and sets the first working switch/group that disables charging.
# If the set switch/group doesn't work, acc unsets chargingSwitch and repeats the above.
# If all switches fail to disable charging, chargingSwitch is unset and acc/d exit with error code 7.
# This automated process can be disabled by appending " --" to "charging_switch=...".
# e.g., acc -s s="battery/charge_enabled 1 0 --"
# charging_switch=milliamps (e.g., 0, 250 or 500) enables current-based charging control.
# For details, refer to the readme's tips section.
# Unlike the original variant, this kind of switch is never unset automatically.
# Appending " --" to it leads to invalid syntax.

# apply_on_boot (ab) #
# Settings to apply on boot or daemon start/restart.
# The --exit flag (refer back to applyOnBoot=...) tells the daemon to stop after applying settings.
# If the --exit flag is not included, default values are restored when the daemon stops.

# apply_on_plug (ap) #
# Settings to apply on plug
# This exists because some /sys files (e.g., current_max) are reset on charger re-plug.
# Default values are restored on unplug and when the daemon stops.

# max_charging_current (mcc) #
# max_charging_voltage (mcv) #
# Only the current/voltage value is to be supplied.
# Control files are automatically selected.
# Refer back to the command examples.

# lang (l) #
# acc language, managed with "acc --set --lang" (acc -s l).

# run_cmd_on_pause (rcp) #
# Run commands* after pausing charging.
# * Usually a script ("sh some_file" or ". some_file")

# amp_factor (af) #
# volt_factor (vf) #
# Unit multiplier for conversion (e.g., 1V = 1000000 Microvolts)
# ACC can automatically determine the units, but the mechanism is not 100% foolproof.
# e.g., if the input current is too low, the unit is miscalculated.
# This issue is rare, though.
# Leave these properties alone if everything is running fine.

# loop_cmd (lc) #
# This is meant for extending accd's functionality.
# It is periodically executed by is_charging() - which is called regularly, within the main accd loop.
# The boolean isCharging is available.
# Refer back to COMMAND EXAMPLES.

# prioritize_batt_idle_mode (pbim) #
# If enabled charging switches that support battery idle mode take precedence.
# This is disabled by default due to issues on Samsung (store_mode) and other devices.

# currentWorkaround (current_workaround) #
# Only use current control files whose paths match "batt" (default: false).
# This is necessary only if the current limit affects both input and charging current values.
# A reboot is required after changing this.
